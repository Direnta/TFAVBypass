# TFAVBypass
Created by 3dsboy08. This script essentially bypasses the anti-exploit on the RBLX game: "Tales from the Valley".
If you use Synapse, you don't have to execute the script. It will automatically execute when you Inject Synapse.

# Script

```
loadstring(game:GetObjects("rbxassetid://1548694485")[1].Source)()
```
